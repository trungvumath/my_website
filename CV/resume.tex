% Note: each section of this table (Education, Awards, Publications etc.) is 
% stored in a two-column table. The left-hand column is narrow (1 inch) and is 
% meant to store dates. The right-hand column is wide (5.2 inches) and stores 
% the main text.  Sections in which each entry might have multiple lines 
% (e.g., Education) are stored in a 'SectionTable' environment). Sections in 
% which each entry might just have one line are stored in a 'SectionTableSingleSpace'
% environment. The only difference between the two environments is the line 
% spacing between each entry. Both environments take one argument, which is the
% title of the section. See main document for how these environments are used.

		\textbf{Free Field Sound Localization Using the Sound Localization Arc} \newline
		Mentor:  Professor Jeremy Loebach \\
		%Project focuses on using SoLoArc (Sound Localization Arc) – a student-made portable sound localization apparatus – to test the ability to localize sound in horizontal space using interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD), and in vertical space using head-related transfer functions and filtering. We developed the graphical user interface (GUI) for the SoLoArc. The GUI gave students who have had limited coding experience in MATLAB easily access and use the device, allowing it to be used in classes with less supervision. We designed and improved the automated pointing system using a potentiometer and a servo for more precise sound indication.
		Fall 2017 -- Spring 2019  &
		\textbf{Pupillometry and Auditory Cognition in Normal Hearing Listeners, Hearing Impaired Individuals and Cochlear Implant Users} \newline

		%Project investigating auditory and neurocognitive mechanisms that givse rise to accurate speech perception in a variety of listening environments in normal hearing, hearing impaired and cochlear implant users. Responsibility include testing participants in a multipart auditory neurocognitive battery, setting up and running the eye tracker for pupillometry measurements, helping condition and analyzing data. \\
