\title{Math 199 CD3 Merit Worksheet 2: Integration by parts }
\date{\today}


\begin{document}

\maketitle
After $u$ substitution, integration by part is the next important technique that you need to master. A personal tip I can give for this technique is always try to look for terms that are easier for integrating first, i.e. the $dv$ part. It could be slow at first but once you develop enough intuition you will be able to go quite far. Good luck and have fun with the worksheet!!!!!!!!!
