\maketitle
For the following problem, find the center of mass of the following regions:
\be

	\item The region  bounded by $y=4-x^2$ that is in the first quadrant
	\vfill
	\item The region bounded by $y=3-e^{-x}$, the $x$-axis, $x=2$ and the $y$-axis
	\vfill
	\item The triangle with vertices $(-2,-2), (4,-2), (4,4)$
	\vfill
	\newpage
	\item the function $y=\cos x$ and the $x$-axis  between $\frac{-\pi}{2}\leq x\leq\frac{\pi}{2}$
	\vfill
	\item The 2 functions $y=x^2$ and $y=6-x$
	\vfill
	\item The function $y=e^{2x}$ and the $x$-axis between $-1\leq x\leq 1$\vfill
