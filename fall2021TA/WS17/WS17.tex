		\item A farmer wishes to fence in a rectangular field of 10,000 square ft . The north-south fences will cost 1.50 dollars per foot, while the east-west fences will cost 6.00 dollars per foot. Find the dimensions of the field that will minimize the cost.

		\item A rectangular bin, open at the top, is required to contain 128 cubic meters. If the bottom is to be a square, at a cost of 2 dollars per square meter, while the sides cost 0.50 dollars per square meter, what dimensions will minimize the cost?
