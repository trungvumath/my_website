		\item Assume that the number of bacteria in a culture grows exponentially with a growth constant of $0.02$, time being	measured in hours. (Although the number of bacteria must be a nonnegative integer, the assumption that the
		number is a continuous quantity always seems to lead to results that are experimentally verified.)
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item How many bacteria will be present after 1 hour if there are initially 1000?
			\vskip 3cm
			\item Given the same initial 1000 bacteria, in how many hours will there be 100 000 bacteria?
			\vskip 3cm

		\item Solve the following differential equations given that the graph of each solution goes through the point (0,10).\\

		\begin{enumerate}

		\item $\displaystyle\frac{ds}{dt} = 12s$\\
		\vskip 2cm
		\item 	$\displaystyle\frac{ds}{dt} = -2s$\\
